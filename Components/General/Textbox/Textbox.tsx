          <li>Unlike social media sites, LibertyMeets
            is geared toward in-person connections to
            form local bonds and take action in your community.

          <li>Many conservative/libertarians/moderates
            of all ages would like to get more involved
            politically but don't know exactly how,
            beyond contacting representatives/campaigns,
            searching in a roundabout way where/how to volunteer,
            responding to solicitations, posting on social media,
            and voting.
          </li>
          <li>They would also like to find new like-minded
            peers to engage with socially and professionally,
            especially younger adults who may feel isolated in
            progressive cities and organizations. Their fervor
            is being undeserved without a clearer and easier way
            to connect in-person with other freedom-oriented people.
