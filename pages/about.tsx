            Unlike social media sites, LibertyMeets is geared toward in-person
            connections to form local bonds and take action in your community.
            Explore and post opportunities to find other freedom-oriented
            individuals, businesses, non-profits, and campaigns.

            Sign up information is to ensure users are connecting with real

            and will not share or sell your information. When someone replies to
            your post, or you reply to a post, your email address is anonymous.

            Simplicity and speed are our goals. Anyone can browse and respond to
            public posts. Sign up to post, view and respond to private posts,
            and keep track of your favorite posts. Here's a short video
            exploring the site's functionality.
